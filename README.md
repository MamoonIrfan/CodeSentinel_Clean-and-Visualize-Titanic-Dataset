# Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Visualization  

🚀 This project is part of my **Code Sentinel Internship Task 2**, where I worked on cleaning and visualizing the famous **Titanic Dataset**.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to practice **data preprocessing** and **data visualization** using Python libraries.  

### ✅ Steps Performed
- Handled **missing values** (imputation & dropping).  
- Converted **categorical columns** (`Sex`, `Embarked`) into numeric format.  
- Plotted **survival rates** by:
  - Gender  
  - Passenger Class  

### 📊 Key Insights
- Women had **higher survival rates** compared to men.  
- **First Class passengers** had better survival chances than others.  
- Men in **Third Class** were least likely to survive.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib
